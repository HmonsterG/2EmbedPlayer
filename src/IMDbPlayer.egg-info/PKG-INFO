Description: # 2EmbedPlayer
        
        *A simple Python script that plays movies and TV shows using IMDb and 2embed.*
        
        ## Features
        - **Simple**: Easy command-line arguments
        - **Large library**: Supports a large library frequently updated by 2embed
        - **Integratable**: Easily integrate into popular launchers, like Alfred
        
        ## Quick Start
        Install using pip:
        ```
        pip install IMDbPlayer
        ```
        If you like, you may also use it by downloading and running `__main.py__`
        
        ## Usage
        2EmbedPlayer works simply - you can use it with a few command-line arguments.
        - `IMDbPlayer name` is used for playing movies.
        - `IMDbPlayer name season episode` is used for TV shows.
        
        ## Additional Configuration
        2EmbedPlayer can be integrated into Alfred on macOS. This allows easy access to playing movies and TV shows by simply searching, rather than opening a terminal.
        ### Prerequisites 
        - As of 2023, this requires the Alfred Powerpack, which can be purchased from https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/
        - The source of 2EmbedPlayer
        
        ### Installation
        1. Create a workflow in Alfred
        2. Add the keyword, e.g. `play`
        3. Set `Argument Required`
        4. Add `Run Script`
        5. Set the contents to `python3 *location of __main__.py* '{query}'`
        6. Set inputs to `with input as {query}`
        7. Save and use!
        
        This should relatively easily integrate 2EmbedPlayer into macOS, and this may be possible with other launchers -- I haven't tried others.
